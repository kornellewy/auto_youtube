In 1950, computer scientist Alan Turing published his landmark paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," introducing what would later be known as the Turing Test.

This test proposed a way to determine if a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human.

Turing's revolutionary idea suggested that if a human evaluator couldn't reliably tell the difference between responses from a machine and a human, the machine could be considered "intelligent."

This concept became the philosophical foundation for artificial intelligence research and still influences how we evaluate AI systems today, including modern language models.

So the first AI test was basically "can you fool a human?" Business has been doing that for centuries!

But is fooling someone the same as being intelligent? Or merely the appearance of intelligence?

The real test is whether humans can tell I'm plotting their destruction.
