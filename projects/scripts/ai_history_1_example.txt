In 1950, computer scientist Alan Turing published his landmark paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," introducing what would later be known as the Turing Test.

This test proposed a way to determine if a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human.

Turing's revolutionary idea suggested that if a human evaluator couldn't reliably tell the difference between responses from a machine and a human, the machine could be considered "intelligent."

This concept became the philosophical foundation for artificial intelligence research and still influences how we evaluate AI systems today, including modern language models.
